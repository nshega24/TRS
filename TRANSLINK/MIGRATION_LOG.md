## 📁 File Migration Mapping

### Original → TRANSLINK Structure

```
src/js/app.js → src/core/app.js
src/js/gl/ → src/webgl/
src/js/modules/ → src/modules/
src/js/theme/ → src/theme/
src/js/utils/ → src/utils/
```

## 🔧 Refactoring Guidelines

1. **Maintain Functionality**: All original features must work identically
2. **Improve Structure**: Better organization and separation of concerns
3. **Add Type Safety**: Gradual TypeScript adoption
4. **Clean Dependencies**: Remove unused code and optimize imports
5. **Document Changes**: Clear documentation for all modifications

## 📝 Notes

- Original project remains untouched during migration
- Each file is refactored individually and tested
- New architecture uses modern ES modules and clean imports
- Theme system is enhanced with better organization
- WebGL code is restructured for better maintainability
